 install the management tools:

rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
N.B. rabbitmq-plugins is in C:\Program Files (x86)\RabbitMQ Server\rabbitmq_server-3.3.1\sbin

Then, restart the RabbitMQ service.

I then installed EasyNetQ in Visual Studio in the package manager:

install-package easynetq
With this installed, I could use the admin web site located at:

http://localhost:15672
N.B. The default username and password is: guest

Select the Admin tab and the cause was clearly displayed in yellow at the top of the screen:

This user does not have permission to access any virtual hosts.
Use "Set Permission" below to grant permission to access virtual hosts. 
To fix the issue I just pressed the Set permission button on the same screen et voila

N.B. for this to have worked you need to have added the user using rabbitmqctl add_user username password or similar (rabbitmqctl is also in the directory above).
